# System-Updater

CLI helper for macOS to update various tools (OSX, MAS, Homebrew, NPM, and others)

This is a tool I use on a daily basis to ease the process of having to update a lot of cli tools. Work in progress.

Be carefull what you do. Never run a cli command without knowing the implications ;)
